    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>16 Boston Bibb or butter lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse whole lettuce leaves and pat dry, being careful not to tear them; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease; transfer beef to a bowl. Add onion to the same skillet; cook and stir until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in hoisin sauce, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, and chile pepper sauce until well combined. Add water chestnuts, green onions, sesame oil, and cooked beef; cook and stir until the onions just begin to wilt, about 2 minutes.</li>
